Explanation: For the custom A/B test, I changed the name from blue-background to button-fancy, to change the background color of the button that is used for the speech synthesizer. For the first A/B test, a class named 'blue' had already been made, but here I accessed the element using querySelector(), then I accessed the style.backgroundColor and changed it in a way where the change would happen when the flagValue is true
